These are the button styles for our site. Please only use these button styles.

- The standard button is the main button that will be used. Use this one the most.
- The light button is for darker backgrounds, or for buttons that aren't used that frequently.
- The ghost button should be used the least. Only use if necessary. The main use is for banners with images.

The font size and button padding may be adjusted slightly. Do not increase the padding beyond 2em.
