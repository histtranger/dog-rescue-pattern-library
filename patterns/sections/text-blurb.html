  <p>Loyal Rescue wants to help our foster dogs find their forever homes. The sad reality is that we get the unwanted, unvetted, and uncared for. At Loyal, we have big hearts and even bigger goals to make sure all of our dogs are loved and cared for properly. We want to help them have the best life possible, whether they have years ahead of them or are nearing the end of their journey.</p>
